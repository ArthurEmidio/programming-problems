# Solutions to Programming Problems
This repository contains solutions to several programming problems that I've done in the past. Currently, there are problems from the following online judges:

- [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com)
- [Topcoder](http://topcoder.com)
- [UVa Online Judge](https://uva.onlinejudge.org)
- [URI](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/)
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)

All solutions are implemented in C++11.

Note: the contents of the Codeforces and Topcoder directories are organized in terms of round number.
