# Solutions to Programming Problems
This repository contains solutions to several programming problems that I've done in the past. Currently, there are problems from the following online judges:

- [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com)
- [UVa Online Judge](https://uva.onlinejudge.org)
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)

All solutions are implemented using C++11.

Note: the content of the Codeforces directory is organized in terms of the round number.
